                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"><br>The first KFC restaurant was opened in 1973 on Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman. Today there are more than 500 KFC Restaurants nationwide and still counting. Great tasting chicken has become synonymous with KFC; and has been enjoyed by Malaysians ever since. In fact, KFC Malaysia has developed a distinctive Malaysian personality of its own. <br>Especially for Malaysians<br>We are an establishment that is run by Malaysians and managed by Malaysians; we took it upon ourselves to create a selection of food that would make Malaysia proud on the international scene. Kentucky Nuggets, for example, was conceived in Malaysia and then found its way to KFC worldwide. Today, Kentucky Nuggets is one of KFC's successes.<br>"Meals on Wheels" was also developed in Malaysia. It was created for the purpose of bringing great tasting chicken to places where a KFC Restaurant might not be available. So, any offices or companies can hold functions at any place and anytime!<br>All our achievements add to our Malaysian identity. But it has only been possible because you invited us to share your lives.<br>Just for Kids<br>Then we wanted something really special for our younger customers because they are integral part of our lives. So, the KFC Kids' Chicky Club was developed exclusively for kids. Even 'Chicky', KFC's mascot, takes an active interest in all the KFC Kids' Chicky Club activities.<br>We wanted to give every child something they can look forward to as a treat every weekend or on any special occasion. We sincerely hope that their childhood will be filled with wonderful memories.<br>Thank You, Malaysia... <br>Ultimately, KFC Malaysia has a lot to thank Malaysians for. Especially their support through the years.<br>Something for Malaysians<br>At KFC, we recognize that improving the quality of life and economic vitality of the communities in which we conduct business is in the best interest of our company, our patrons, our employees and our industry.<br>And to show our appreciation for Malaysian support for making us a market leader; all of us here at KFC Malaysia wanted to give something back to the community. So, Projek Penyayang KFC was developed to provide food to 150++ homes every quarter. Projek Penyayang KFC was founded in 1995 in an effort to enable thousands of orphans and underprivileged children to enjoy KFC meals. Over 6,500 children are treated to a finger lickin' good food every year. This year marks the 10th Anniversary of Projek Penyayang.<br>This in turn, was followed by Tabung Penyayang KFC, a charitable fund, whose sole purpose was to help orphanages in Malaysia. Tabung Penyayang was founded in 1997, to help children and the needy&nbsp;through various CSR programme. Tabung Penyayang KFC is a unique fund as it represents a percentage of revenue generated from the sale of KFC's Kids' Fun Meals.<br>In August 1999, KFC introduced its 'Tabung Penyayang' KFC Collection Box as an extension to the Tabung Penyayang KFC Programme. Collection boxes are placed at all KFC restaurants enabling customers to contribute and be apart of this charitable effort.<br>Today, 4 of KFC Restaurants are run by speech and hearing-impaired staffs that was designed to serve physically challenged individuals. They serve to dispel the myth that a disability impede a person from leading a normal life and gives them a sense of confidence and self-esteem.<br>These 4 restaurants are located in Peninsular and East Malaysia. First is at Sentul Raya, in Kuala Lumpur, second is at Saujana, in Sarawak, the third is at Tanjung Aru, Sabah and 4th Johor.<br>Currently, we are still conducting other programmes for Malaysian charities. And we will continue to extend a corporate helping hand whenever and wherever we can.&nbsp;<br></p>
